        The fasting blood sugar (FBS) test determines the actual concentration of glucose in your blood without consumption of any diet. FBS test is frequently recommended in patients to determine whether glucose levels are controlled by the injection of insulin hormone in case of type 1 diabetes and whether the body is able to use insulin in case of type 2 diabetes. Elevated levels of fasting blood sugar can be an indication of Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. If untreated, can lead to severe health-related consequences like delayed wound healing, damage to the eyes (Diabetic retinopathy), kidney (renal failure), nerves (peripheral neuropathy), and heart (myocardial infarction). Book your FBS Test at a low cost and get a home collection facility.
